# NBT

The NBT (Named Binary Tag) format is used in the game Minecraft for storing different information. This library allows
you to read and write those nbt data. The reader/writer mechanisms allows you to implement your own data sources (e.g.
ByteBuf from Netty).

More information about the NBT format can be found here: [http://wiki.vg/NBT](http://wiki.vg/NBT).

## ToDo

 * Save states to ensure a nbt file is read and written correctly
 * Add javadocs
 * Unit test all the things
